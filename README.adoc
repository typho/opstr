What is it about?
-----------------

As a software developer, I often need to look at strings and apply operations to it.
I frequently use python on the commandline or resort to client-side web applications.
But the operations are always the same and should be accessible with one CLI call.

I built opstr, so you can throw a bunch of strings in and get the result of various operations out.
Or you specify an operation and get a predictable result.

Why should I use it?
--------------------

To apply operations to strings.

Who should use it?
------------------

Anyone working with text strings (in the Unicode sense: as sequence of codepoints).

How to install
--------------

Adding your own function
------------------------

If you have a new function to implement â€¦

1. Decide the CATEGORY it fits into (e.g. "charsets")
2. Decide upon a function NAME
3. Create the file src/ops/CATEGORY/NAME.rs
4. Add the function to src/ops/mod.rs
5. The file must implement the function with one of the traits from src/ops/traits.rs
